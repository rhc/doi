        <![CDATA[Vadu Rural Health Program, KEM Hospital Research Centre Pune has a rich tradition in health care and development being in the forefront of needs-based, issue-driven research over almost 35 years. During the decades of 1980 and 1990 the research at Vadu focused on mother and child with epidemiological and social science research exploring low birth weight, child survival, maternal mortality, safe abortion and domestic violence. The research portfolio has ever since expanded to include adult health and aging, non-communicable and communicable diseases and to clinical trials in recent years. It started with establishment of Health and Demographic Surveillance System <http://www.kemhospitalvadu.org/hdss.asp> at Vadu (HDSS Vadu) in August, 2002 that seeks to establish a quasi-experimental design setting to allow evaluation of impact of health interventions as well as monitor secular trends in diseases, risk factors and health behavior of humans. 

Vadu has struck research alliances with Regional, National and International Organizations. The iSHARE (www.indepth-ishare.org <http://www.indepth-ishare.org>)- is a novel globally applicable solution from Vadu for enabling INDEPTH Network members to share their data on the web. IMVAC is an international collaboration with the Chest Research Foundation, Pune and the Imperial College, London to better understand COPD in developing world context. The Influenza Disease Burden in India (IDBI) study, in partnership with the National Institute of Virology, Pune and CDC Atlanta, is well placed to follow the influenza in rural areas. Vadu's foray into large community based GCP compliant phase II/III vaccine trials for meningitis, measles, HIB, typhoid and rota-virus is another important step in getting safe, effective and yet less expensive/affordable indigenously produced vaccines to licensure and use in India and globally. A recent strategic 5-year award jointly with paediatrics department of KEM, from the Dept. of Biotechnology, GOI is helping us build capacity to develop a Core Vaccine Research Unit at Vadu. 
An exciting array of Translational Research (G2P studies) is ongoing at Vadu in collaboration with Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, GOI from both Ayurvedic and disease perspective. Vadu has extensively contributed to Project Ayurgenomics: Integration of Ayurveda to Genomics for field based research. 10000 volunteers from Vadu area participated in this study. Vadu has also developed a detailed phenotyping (DP) unit and molecular biology laboratory for primary investigations. The DP unit includes State of the art labs for heart rate variability testing, spirometry, skin testing, anthropometry and gustatory testing. Probably the only molecular biology lab in rural area, our lab is well equipped for RNA and DNA isolation and detection besides a dedicated fully equipped section for the clinical trials laboratory work. 

Today's strength of Vadu is its ability to integrate research among and rational medical service delivery to the populations with support from the community and with capacity building of this very community in conducting community or hospital based research. Vadu strives to address its research needs through partnerships and collaborations with national and international institutions guided by principles of interdependence, equality, technology transfer and joint data ownership as also authorship. Above all, we believe in ethics and practice in conducting utmost ethical research.

We independently track vital events including births, deaths, causes of death, pregnancy outcome, migrations and marital status changes and serves to monitor trends in fertility and mortality inter alia over time. 

The word "Demographic Surveillance" means to keep close track of the population dynamics. Vadu HDSS deals with keeping track of health issues and demographic changes in Vadu rural health program (VRHP) area. It is one of the most promising projects of National relevance that aims at establishing a quasi-experimental intervention research setting with objectives.

1. To create a longitudinal data base for
           a. Efficient service delivery,
           b. Future research 
           c. Linking all past micro-studies in Vadu area 
2. Monitoring trends in public health problems 
3. Keeping track of population dynamics 
4. Evaluation of intervention services.]]>

          <![CDATA[1) Training of Fieldworkers:

Training is planned and executed at the centre ie at Vadu HDSS every six months before the data collection round begins. Five days training session is conducted and every training session is evaluated by both the trainees and trainers. Trainers complete daily evaluation by asking questions in order to identify problems that trainees had experienced during that particular day’s training. Areas that needed re- training are revisited the following day. At the end of the training moc interviews are conducted by the trainees.

Survey:

The data collection approach revolves around the use of a team of Field Research Assistants and Field Research Supervisors. The team is assigned a fixed number of EAs to enumerate. The team works together in each sampled EA and moves to the next one, once the targeted EA had been completed. The advantage of this method is that the supervisor is in daily in contact with the team, which improves the quality of the data collection during fieldwork.

Supervisors go to the FRA who have completed the interview and immediately check the questionnaire for errors, consistency and completeness. Where errors are found, the FRA is sent back to the household to correct the information that had been recorded previously. If the supervisors are satisfied, they sign off the questionnaire and store it in a safe place. Supervisors do the same for all the members of their team until the EA had been completed. The team then moves to another selected EA.

The interview is conducted face - to -face which takes approximately 15 - 30 minutes each and this entire process takes around 5 months for every round.

4. Automated field validation was used on all the forms along with pre manual checking.
5. MySQL Database was used.
6. The ETL process is performed using Pentaho Data Integration Community Edition (PDI CE) - Kettle 4.2. All necessary validation checks, quality checks and transformations are designed and implemented using PDI and inconsistencies identified are eliminated from the data set and thus the core micro data set is produced.]]>
