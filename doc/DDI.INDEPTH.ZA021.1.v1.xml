        <![CDATA[Changes in socio-economic status and lifestyle behaviours among the adult population in South Africa not only in urban areas but also in rural South Africa, have led to increased prevalence of chronic diseases and associated risk factors, together with an epidemic of some infectious diseases. Researchers at the University of the North ( now University of Limpopo Turfloop campus) established The Dikgale centre for Health and Demographic surveillance system  in 1996 funded by a core grant from NUFU, Norway. 
The broad aim of the Dikgale HDSS is to provide information to improve health of the people in Limpopo province and to assist the local government in making effective health care policy. As few data are available on the prevalence of diseases  in rural and peri-urban areas  of Limpopo province, the initial objective of the HDSS was to establish a field site where the incidence and prevalence of diseases could be assessed.  It was therefore necessary to collect longitudinal demographic data (e.g. mortality, fertility, migration) on the population. To this end, three primary subjects are observed longitudinally in Dikgale HDSS: physical structures (e.g. homesteads, clinics and schools), households and individuals. The information about these subjects, and all related information, was at first stored  in Access and later in a single MSSQL Server database, in a truly longitudinal way—i.e. not as a series of cross-sections.
The surveillance area is located in the Capricorn district, Limpopo province approximately 40 km from Polokwane, the capital city of Limpopo province and 15-50 km from the University of Limpopo (Turfloop campus). The site covers an area of approximately 200 square kilometres. The initially the total population was 8000 but the field site was expanded in 2010 and now includes approximately 35,000 people who are members of approximately 7000 households . The households are present in 15 villages of varying sizes.  The population is Northern Sotho speaking . All households have electricity. Some households have piped water either inside the house or in their yards, but most fetch water from taps situated at strategic points in the villages. Most households have a pit latrine in their yards. A large proportion of adults are migrant workers, while others work as farm labourers on neighbouring farms, or as domestic workers in nearby towns. Many are pensioners. The unemployment rate in the area is high.
To fulfil the eligibility criteria for the Dikgale HDSS cohort, individuals must be a member of a household within the surveillance area but not necessarily resident within it. Crucially, this means that Dikgale HDSS collects information on resident and non-resident members of households and makes a distinction between membership (self-defined on the basis of links to other household members) and residency (residing at a physical structure within the surveillance area at a particular point in time). Individuals can be members of more than one household at any point in time (e.g. polygamously married men whose wives maintain separate households).  To be consistent with similar datasets from other INDEPTH Member centres, this data set contains data from resident members only.
During data collection, households are visited by fieldworkers and information supplied by a single key informant. All births, deaths and migrations of household members are recorded. If household members have moved internally within the surveillance area, such moves are reconciled and the internal migrant retains the original identfier associated with him/her.]]>

          <![CDATA[On data entry data consistency and plausibility were checked by 455 data validation rules at database level. If data validation failure was due to a data collection error, the questionnaire was referred back to the field for revisit and correction. 

No imputations were done on the resulting micro data set, except for:

a. If an out-migration (OMG) event is followed by a homestead entry event (ENT) and the gap between OMG event and ENT event is greater than 180 days, the ENT event was changed to an in-migration event (IMG).

b. If an out-migration (OMG) event is followed by a homestead entry event (ENT) and the gap between OMG event and ENT event is less than 180 days, the OMG event was changed to an homestead exit event (EXT) and the ENT event date changed to the day following the original OMG event.

c. If a homestead exit event (EXT) is followed by an in-migration event (IMG) and the gap between the EXT event and the IMG event is greater than 180 days, the EXT event was changed to an out-migration event (OMG).

d. If a homestead exit event (EXT) is followed by an in-migration event (IMG) and the gap between the EXT event and the IMG event is less than 180 days, the IMG event was changed to an homestead entry event (ENT) with a date equal to the day following the EXT event.

e. If the last recorded event for an individual is homestead exit (EXT) and this event is more than 180 days prior to the end of the surveillance period, then the EXT event is changed to an out-migration event (OMG)]]>

      <notes>
        <![CDATA[All homesteads in the Dikgale HDSS were geocoded and entered into a geographic information system (GIS) prior to the start of surveillance. 

How document control was conducted to ensure all census forms were completed?

Before the round, a SQL script generated a list of questionnaires to be printed for each household resident in the surveillance area. Each questionnaire is given a unique integer key which is printed as a barcode on the questionnaire. A series of web-based reports called 'Unified Reports' are then used to track and control the status of each questionnaire from document production, data collection, data entry and document archiving. A strict chain of custody is enforced for all questionnaire movements.

A data entry is performed by one data capturer with one supervisor using in-house developed software (Delphi and .NET C#). 
Data is stored in a MS SQL database, with transaction logging, daily backups and twice weekly off-site backups. Constraints and validation rules placed on the database help in checking data quality during data entry. 

Because of error in data entry 100% recheck was done on all entries.

Field QC Procedures

The team leader checks the conduct  of the interviewer.


After data collection and before data entry, the  questionnaires are checked for completeness, consistency and accuracy. If a questionnaire failed to meet the quality standard requirements, the questionnaire is sent back the questionnaires to the team leader.



Specify how the data was extracted (including which software program was used) to produce the core micro data set. How was inconsistent records dealt with during this process?

Following data collection and data entry completion  a snapshot of the operational database is created as an analytical database. This snapshot is uniquely identified and analytical datasets must reference the analytical database they originated from..

An SQL script produces a normalised episode table each time an analytical database is created. This episode table contains an exposure record for each exposure episode for an individual, from initial enumeration, birth or in-migration, up to eventual death or out-migration. The episode table contains the start event and date of the exposure as well as the end event and date of the end of exposure. Individuals that out-migrate and later in-migrate are reconciled as far as possible using individual identifiers (national identity number, names, sex and date of birth) under a single individual identity. All internal movements (migrations) are reconciled and residencies at different homesteads within the surveillance area are reflected as separate episodes in the episode table.

To produce this micro-data set, the episode table is processed using Pentaho Kettle ETL program to produce this standard event-history format dataset.]]>
